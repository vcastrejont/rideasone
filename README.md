# Nearsoft Car Pooling app

### Executive Summary
Corporate web system and mobile application for carpooling to the office with fellow Nearsoftians.

### The problem
Most Nearsoftians drive to work everyday by themselves, this causes the parking lot to be very cluttered and makes it hard to find available parking spaces. Also, Nearsoftians in the Onboarding process are sometimes from a different city and don't have cars, so they rely on lifts to get to the office. 

### Solution
A web and mobile application to share rides with co-workers.

### Goal for the prototype
Develop a mobile and web application where Nearsoftians can access the rides available to work and to specific events (work and social) where they can share their cars through different features in the platform. 

### User Description
For internal use of Nearsoftians, both who need a lift and who want to share rides.
